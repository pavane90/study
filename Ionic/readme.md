### Announcing Ionic 5!

Segment
The iOS Segment design changed drastically from the previous iOS version. Prior to iOS 13, borders and a filled background were used to differentiate between checked and unchecked buttons. With the latest design update, a single indicator is now used to slide between the buttons, checking the one it ends on. This update includes a gesture that can be used to drag the indicator. Below is a comparison between Ionic 4 and Ionic 5.
